    "biography": "I am a Computer Engineering student in my fourth year out of five at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am enrolled in the 4+1 Master's Program to receive my Master's Degree as well, which I am also doing in the field of Computer Engineering, with a software concentration. I am actually taking this class as one of the requirements for my Master's Degree, especially since this class is very useful in learning more areas of programming and gaining a lot more experience. \nI live and grew up in Paramus, New Jersey. My parents are divorced, and my father lives in Hillsdale, New Jersey, which isn't very far from Paramus. I have one younger brother who is a junior in high school right now, the same high school that I attended. I am a member and the current president of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity at Stevens, where I spend a lot of my free time doing service events, managing the organization, and simply having fun with my friends and brothers.",
